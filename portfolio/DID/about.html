    <h3>Final Project for Dynamic Interface Design</h3>

    <p>CSSound my final project for Dynamic Interface Design at Wellesley College Fall 2015. After doing my first two major projects using Flash Animation, I wanted to do something different for my final. Fortunately, we were given creative flexibility and I decided I wanted to learn a new skill. I’m interested in front-end development, so I decided to write my project in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I felt that these languages were more applicable to my major, Software Product Design, and I would challenge myself. </p>

    <p>
      The concept is simple, each of the number keys, 0-9, as well as the space bar, are mapped to an animation and a sound. This creates a pleasant yet surprising audio-visual experience. Each animation is set to 50% opacity, creating an overlaying effect of the animations as multiple keys can be pressed in succession to make patterns and artistic effects. The space bar changes the background color, changing the feel of the piece. </p>

      <p>I achieved this project using primarily CSS animations and JQuery. I found the sounds for free on SoundSwap, and wanted electronic drum sounds yet still ambient. I worked to develop the animations using CSS transitions with the different ‘div’ elements in the HTML. Each key press triggers the adding of a CSS class to the ‘div,’ which then delays waiting for the animation to finish, then removes the class. This was achieved using JQuery. I initially load all of the sounds to prevent from too much lag when the keys are pressed. </p>

      <p>I hope you enjoy this site as much as I enjoyed making it. Thanks for visiting!</p>
